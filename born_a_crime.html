        <h1>Chapter One</h1>
        <p>
            In the first chapter, there is a significant event where Trevor's mother, in a moment of danger, throws him out of a moving vehicle to protect him. This incident showed the impact of apartheid on different South African tribes. Before apartheid, tribes were divided to create conflict. After apartheid, tensions between tribes escalated. Trevor's mother's actions, like making the family attend multiple churches highlight her resilience and determination in challenging societal norms.

            <h1>Chapter Two</h1>
        <p>
            Trevor Noah talks about the difficulties of growing up in South Africa during apartheid, concentrating on the anxiety and uncertainty that his mother and mixed-race family experienced. The chapter emphasizes his mother's resilience and endurance, as well as that of others who faced endless worry about being taken away because they were colored. Noah's birth was considered a "crime" under apartheid rules, which forbade men and women of various races from having children together. Trevor Noah was born to a white father, thus he was colored and unable to socialize with other children while growing up.

        <h1> Connecting With Nairobi</h1>
        <p>
            In Nairobi, we face challenges similar to those in South Africa, where persons from certain ethnic groups are favored. Whites also have an advantage in accessing services, and Kenya is still attempting to serve everyone fairly.
